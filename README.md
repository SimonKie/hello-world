# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub, created on 2016-07-25.

As GitHub will probably be important in my future studies, it's for the best if I check it out as early as possible, I guess. Doing so, I get to know the workflow that Git intends as well as specific terms like "merge", "branch", "commit", "push" or "pull".
